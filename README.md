Receiving hundreds or thousands of mails a day and then figuring out which mail should be directed to which person can be a daunting task. This project aims to tackle that problem. We created a solution that can effectively classify emails based on not only their content, but also the context in which they are written, and then route them to the respective department(s) or person(s) in charge.

## Problem Statement

### Email classification based on the content

Multiple emails from customers/clients that are dealt with different teams based on the context. This solution should enable auto-classification of emails based on the context, so the same can be routed to best suited team for further processing.

### Technology

- Python
- Anaconda platform

### Other Considerations

The data selected should represent sufficient variation to be able to demonstrate classification clearly. Expectation from participants will be to present overall solution with clear focus on characteristics of data and holistic nature of the implementation.
Data

For solving this problem, participants can decide to leverage data available on public forums like Kaggle (preferably from finance domain). But the model should be easy to configure/retrain for similar topics.

### Design Considerations

This model should be easy to deploy to execute either as batch or real time.

Focus should also be on making it efficient from resource consumption standpoint and something that can be hosted as containers.

### Benefits

Auto-email classification will enable significant reduction in manual efforts

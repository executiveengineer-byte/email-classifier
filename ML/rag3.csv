 'the guidance also requires improved disclosures on the nature , amount , timing , and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized .'

 'the loss on the debt itself is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the liability component of the original notes 2019 amount retired immediately before the exchange and its related carrying value immediately before the exchange .'

 'in addition , under this accounting standard , a portion of the fair value of the consideration transferred is allocated to the reacquisition of the equity component , which is the difference between the fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the liability component immediately before the exchange .'
 'as a result , $ 39.9 million was allocated to the reacquisition of the equity component of the original instrument , which is recorded net of deferred taxes within capital in excess of par value .'
 'since the exchange notes have the same characteristics as the original notes and can be settled in cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock ( i.e. , partial settlement ) , the company is required to account for the liability and equity components of its exchange notes separately to reflect its nonconvertible debt borrowing rate .'
 'the company estimated the fair value of the exchange notes liability component to be $ 349.0 million using a discounted cash flow technique .'
 'key inputs used to estimate the fair value of the liability component included the company 2019s estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate as of november 18 , 2010 ( the date the convertible notes were issued ) , the amount and timing of cash flows , and the expected life of the exchange notes .'
 'the company used an estimated effective interest rate of 6.52% ( 6.52 % ) .'
 'the excess of the fair value transferred over the estimated fair value of the liability component totaling $ 97.3 million was allocated to the conversion feature as an increase to capital in excess of par value with a corresponding offset recognized as a discount to reduce the net carrying value of the exchange notes .'
 'as a result of the fair value of the exchange notes being lower than the exchange notes principal value , there is an additional discount on the exchange notes of $ 3.7 million at the measurement date .'
 'the total discount is being amortized to interest expense over a six-year period ending december 15 , 2016 ( the expected life of the liability component ) using the effective interest method .'

 'this portfolio represents loans acquired in the washing- ton mutual transaction that were recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition .'
 'that fair value included an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans , and therefore no allowance for loan losses was recorded for these loans as of the acquisition date .'
 'the firm regularly updates the amount of principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected for these loans .'
 'probable decreases in expected loan principal cash flows would trigger the recognition of impairment through the provision for loan losses .'
 'probable and significant increases in expected cash flows ( e.g. , decreased principal credit losses , the net benefit of modifications ) would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan losses , with any remaining increase in the expected cash flows recognized prospectively in interest income over the remaining estimated lives of the underlying loans .'
 'during 2010 , management concluded as part of the firm 2019s regular assessment of the pci pools that it was probable that higher expected principal credit losses would result in a decrease in expected cash flows .'
 'accordingly , the firm recognized an aggregate $ 3.4 billion impairment related to the home equity , prime mortgage , option arm and subprime mortgage pci portfolios .'
 'as a result of this impairment , the firm 2019s allowance for loan losses for the home equity , prime mortgage , option arm and subprime mortgage pci portfolios was $ 1.6 billion , $ 1.8 billion , $ 1.5 billion and $ 98 million , respectively , at december 31 , 2010 , compared with an allowance for loan losses of $ 1.1 billion and $ 491 million for the prime mortgage and option arm pci portfolios , respectively , at december 31 , 2009 .'

 'the contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk should the counterpar- ties draw down on these commitments or the firm fulfills its obliga- tion under these guarantees , and should the counterparties subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these con- tracts .'
 'wholesale lending-related commitments were $ 346.1 billion at december 31 , 2010 , compared with $ 347.2 billion at december 31 , 2009 .'
 'the decrease reflected the january 1 , 2010 , adoption of accounting guidance related to vies .'

 'in the firm 2019s view , the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is not representative of the firm 2019s actual credit risk exposure or funding requirements .'
 'in determining the amount of credit risk exposure the firm has to wholesale lend- ing-related commitments , which is used as the basis for allocating credit risk capital to these commitments , the firm has established a 201cloan-equivalent 201d amount for each commitment ; this amount represents the portion of the unused commitment or other contin- gent exposure that is expected , based on average portfolio histori- cal experience , to become drawn upon in an event of a default by an obligor .'
 'the loan-equivalent amounts of the firm 2019s lending- related commitments were $ 189.9 billion and $ 179.8 billion as of december 31 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively .'
 'country exposure the firm 2019s wholesale portfolio includes country risk exposures to both developed and emerging markets .'
 'the firm seeks to diversify its country exposures , including its credit-related lending , trading and investment activities , whether cross-border or locally funded .'
 'country exposure under the firm 2019s internal risk management ap- proach is reported based on the country where the assets of the obligor , counterparty or guarantor are located .'
 'exposure amounts , including resale agreements , are adjusted for collateral and for credit enhancements ( e.g. , guarantees and letters of credit ) pro- vided by third parties ; outstandings supported by a guarantor located outside the country or backed by collateral held outside the country are assigned to the country of the enhancement provider .'
 'in addition , the effect of credit derivative hedges and other short credit or equity trading positions are taken into consideration .'
 'total exposure measures include activity with both government and private-sector entities in a country .'
 'the firm also reports country exposure for regulatory purposes following ffiec guidelines , which are different from the firm 2019s internal risk management approach for measuring country expo- sure .'
 'for additional information on the ffiec exposures , see cross- border outstandings on page 314 of this annual report .'
 'several european countries , including greece , portugal , spain , italy and ireland , have been subject to credit deterioration due to weak- nesses in their economic and fiscal situations .'
 'the firm is closely monitoring its exposures to these five countries .'
 'aggregate net exposures to these five countries as measured under the firm 2019s internal approach was less than $ 15.0 billion at december 31 , 2010 , with no country representing a majority of the exposure .'
 'sovereign exposure in all five countries represented less than half the aggregate net exposure .'
 'the firm currently believes its exposure to these five countries is modest relative to the firm 2019s overall risk expo- sures and is manageable given the size and types of exposures to each of the countries and the diversification of the aggregate expo- sure .'
 'the firm continues to conduct business and support client activity in these countries and , therefore , the firm 2019s aggregate net exposures may vary over time .'
 'in addition , the net exposures may be impacted by changes in market conditions , and the effects of interest rates and credit spreads on market valuations .'
 'as part of its ongoing country risk management process , the firm monitors exposure to emerging market countries , and utilizes country stress tests to measure and manage the risk of extreme loss associated with a sovereign crisis .'

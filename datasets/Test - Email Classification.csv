 'credit derivatives generally require that the seller of credit protection make payments to the buyer upon the occurrence of predefined credit events ( commonly referred to as 201csettlement triggers 201d ) .'
 'these settlement triggers are defined by the form of the derivative and the reference credit and are generally limited to the market standard of failure to pay on indebtedness and bankruptcy of the reference credit and , in a more limited range of transactions , debt restructuring .'
 'credit derivative transactions referring to emerging market reference credits will also typically include additional settlement triggers to cover the acceleration of indebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a payment moratorium .'
 'in certain transactions , protection may be provided on a portfolio of referenced credits or asset-backed securities .'
 'the seller of such protection may not be required to make payment until a specified amount of losses has occurred with respect to the portfolio and/or may only be required to pay for losses up to a specified amount .'
 'the company makes markets in and trades a range of credit derivatives , both on behalf of clients as well as for its own account .'
 'through these contracts , the company either purchases or writes protection on either a single name or a portfolio of reference credits .'
 'the company uses credit derivatives to help mitigate credit risk in its corporate loan portfolio and other cash positions , to take proprietary trading positions , and to facilitate client transactions .'
 'the range of credit derivatives sold includes credit default swaps , total return swaps and credit options .'
 'a credit default swap is a contract in which , for a fee , a protection seller ( guarantor ) agrees to reimburse a protection buyer ( beneficiary ) for any losses that occur due to a credit event on a reference entity .'
 'if there is no credit default event or settlement trigger , as defined by the specific derivative contract , then the guarantor makes no payments to the beneficiary and receives only the contractually specified fee .'
 'however , if a credit event occurs and in accordance with the specific derivative contract sold , the guarantor will be required to make a payment to the beneficiary .'
 'a total return swap transfers the total economic performance of a reference asset , which includes all associated cash flows , as well as capital appreciation or depreciation .'
 'the protection buyer ( beneficiary ) receives a floating rate of interest and any depreciation on the reference asset from the protection seller ( guarantor ) , and in return the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference asset , plus any appreciation .'
 'thus , the beneficiary will be obligated to make a payment any time the floating interest rate payment according to the total return swap agreement and any depreciation of the reference asset exceed the cash flows associated with the underlying asset .'
 'a total return swap may terminate upon a default of the reference asset subject to the provisions in the related total return swap agreement between the protection seller ( guarantor ) and the protection buyer ( beneficiary ) . .']","['billion at december 31 , 2008 and december 31 , 2007 , respectively .'

 'derivative contracts hedging the risks associated with changes in fair value are referred to as fair value hedges , while contracts hedging the variability of expected future cash flows are cash flow hedges .'
 'hedges that utilize derivatives or debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with equity investments in non-u.s.-dollar-functional- currency foreign subsidiaries ( net investment in a foreign operation ) are net investment hedges .'
 'to qualify as an accounting hedge under the hedge accounting rules ( versus an economic hedge where hedge accounting is not applied ) , a hedging relationship must be highly effective in offsetting the risk designated as being hedged .'
 'the hedging relationship must be formally documented at inception , detailing the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge .'
 'this includes the item and risk ( s ) being hedged , the hedging instrument being used and how effectiveness will be assessed .'
 'the effectiveness of these hedging relationships is evaluated at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis both on a retrospective and prospective basis , typically using quantitative measures of correlation , with hedge ineffectiveness measured and recorded in current earnings .'
 'hedge effectiveness assessment methodologies are performed in a similar manner for similar hedges , and are used consistently throughout the hedging relationships .'
 'the assessment of effectiveness may exclude changes in the value of the hedged item that are unrelated to the risks being hedged and the changes in fair value of the derivative associated with time value .'
 'prior to january 1 , 2018 , these excluded items were recognized in current earnings for the hedging derivative , while changes in the value of a hedged item that were not related to the hedged risk were not recorded .'
 'upon adoption of asc 2017-12 , citi excludes changes in the cross currency basis associated with cross currency swaps from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and records it in other comprehensive income .'
 'discontinued hedge accounting a hedging instrument must be highly effective in accomplishing the hedge objective of offsetting either changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item for the risk being hedged .'
 'management may voluntarily de-designate an accounting hedge at any time , but if a hedging relationship is not highly effective , it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting and must be de-designated .'
 'subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in other revenue or principal transactions , similar to trading derivatives , with no offset recorded related to the hedged item .'
 'for fair value hedges , any changes in the fair value of the hedged item remain as part of the basis of the asset or liability and are ultimately realized as an element of the yield on the item .'
 'for cash flow hedges , changes in fair value of the end-user derivative remain in accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) ( aoci ) and are included in the earnings of future periods when the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings .'
 'however , if it becomes probable that some or all of the hedged forecasted transactions will not occur , any amounts that remain in aoci related to these transactions must be immediately reflected in other revenue .'

 '157 , fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date .'
 'sfas no .'
 '157 describes three approaches to measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities : the market approach , the income approach and the cost approach , each of which includes multiple valuation techniques .'
 'the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities .'
 'the income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts , such as cash flows or earnings , into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts .'
 'the cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset .'
 'this is often referred to as current replacement cost .'
 'the cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility , adjusted for obsolescence .'
 'sfas no .'
 '157 does not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques .'
 'sfas no .'
 '157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques .'
 'inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions , including assumptions about risk .'
 'level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority .'
 'the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows .'
 '2022 level 1 2013 observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the reporting date .'
 'active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis .'
 '2022 level 2 2013 observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data .'
 'these are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1 , which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date .'
 '2022 level 3 2013 unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management 2019s best estimate of fair value .'
 'we use a market or income approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to use the best information available .'
 'accordingly , valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored .'
 'financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement .'

 'the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities .'
 'the income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts , such as cash flows or earnings , into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts .'
 'the cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset .'
 'this is often referred to as current replacement cost .'
 'the cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility , adjusted for obsolescence .'

 'citigroup 2019s risk-weighted assets are principally derived from application of the risk-based capital guidelines related to the measurement of credit risk .'
 'pursuant to these guidelines , on-balance-sheet assets and the credit equivalent amount of certain off-balance-sheet exposures ( such as financial guarantees , unfunded lending commitments , letters of credit , and derivatives ) are assigned to one of several prescribed risk-weight categories based upon the perceived credit risk associated with the obligor , or if relevant , the guarantor , the nature of the collateral , or external credit ratings .'
 'risk-weighted assets also incorporate a measure for market risk on covered trading account positions and all foreign exchange and commodity positions whether or not carried in the trading account .'

 'citigroup engaged the services of an independent valuation specialist to assist in the valuation of the reporting unit at july 1 , 2010 , using a combination of the market approach and income approach consistent with the valuation model used in past practice , which considered the impact of the penalty fee provisions associated with the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 ( card act ) that were implemented during 2010 .'
 'under the market approach for valuing this reporting unit , the key assumption is the selected price multiple .'

 'in arriving at the terminal value for local consumer lending 2014cards , using 2013 as the terminal year , the assumptions used include a long-term growth rate and a price-to-tangible book multiple based on selected public guideline companies for the reporting unit .'

 'embedded in the key assumptions underlying the valuation model , described above , is the inherent uncertainty regarding the possibility that economic conditions may deteriorate or other events will occur that will impact the business model for local consumer lending 2014cards .'
 'while there is inherent uncertainty embedded in the assumptions used in developing management 2019s forecasts , the company utilized a discount rate at july 1 , 2010 that it believes reflects the risk characteristics and uncertainty specific to management 2019s forecasts and assumptions for the local consumer lending 2014cards reporting unit .'

 'as a general rule , hedge accounting is permitted where the company is exposed to a particular risk , such as interest rate or foreign exchange risk , that causes changes in the fair value of an asset or liability or variability in the expected future cash flows of an existing asset , liability or a forecasted transaction that may affect earnings .'
 'derivative contracts hedging the risks associated with changes in fair value are referred to as fair value hedges , while contracts hedging the variability of expected future cash flows are cash flow hedges .'
 'hedges that utilize derivatives or debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with equity investments in non-u.s.-dollar-functional- currency foreign subsidiaries ( net investment in a foreign operation ) are net investment hedges .'
 'to qualify as an accounting hedge under the hedge accounting rules ( versus an economic hedge where hedge accounting is not applied ) , a hedging relationship must be highly effective in offsetting the risk designated as being hedged .'
 'the hedging relationship must be formally documented at inception , detailing the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge .'
 'this includes the item and risk ( s ) being hedged , the hedging instrument being used and how effectiveness will be assessed .'
 'the effectiveness of these hedging relationships is evaluated at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis both on a retrospective and prospective basis , typically using quantitative measures of correlation , with hedge ineffectiveness measured and recorded in current earnings .'
 'hedge effectiveness assessment methodologies are performed in a similar manner for similar hedges , and are used consistently throughout the hedging relationships .'
 'the assessment of effectiveness may exclude changes in the value of the hedged item that are unrelated to the risks being hedged and the changes in fair value of the derivative associated with time value .'
 'prior to january 1 , 2018 , these excluded items were recognized in current earnings for the hedging derivative , while changes in the value of a hedged item that were not related to the hedged risk were not recorded .'
 'upon adoption of asc 2017-12 , citi excludes changes in the cross currency basis associated with cross currency swaps from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and records it in other comprehensive income .'
 'discontinued hedge accounting a hedging instrument must be highly effective in accomplishing the hedge objective of offsetting either changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item for the risk being hedged .'
 'management may voluntarily de-designate an accounting hedge at any time , but if a hedging relationship is not highly effective , it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting and must be de-designated .'
 'subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in other revenue or principal transactions , similar to trading derivatives , with no offset recorded related to the hedged item .'
 'for fair value hedges , any changes in the fair value of the hedged item remain as part of the basis of the asset or liability and are ultimately realized as an element of the yield on the item .'
 'for cash flow hedges , changes in fair value of the end-user derivative remain in accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) ( aoci ) and are included in the earnings of future periods when the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings .'
 'however , if it becomes probable that some or all of the hedged forecasted transactions will not occur , any amounts that remain in aoci related to these transactions must be immediately reflected in other revenue .'

 'to qualify as an accounting hedge under the hedge accounting rules ( versus an economic hedge where hedge accounting is not applied ) , a hedging relationship must be highly effective in offsetting the risk designated as being hedged .'
 'the hedging relationship must be formally documented at inception , detailing the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge .'
 'this includes the item and risk ( s ) being hedged , the hedging instrument being used and how effectiveness will be assessed .'
